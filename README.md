1. Plot new users acquired every month on a bar chart (New user in a month = a customer who has placed a
    request for the first time in this month)

2. 30-Day repeat rate is defined as percentage of new users who have placed a 2nd order within 30 days of 
    placing their first order.What is the 30-day repeat rate of users acquired in December 2017?

3. What is the 90-day repeat rate of users acquired in Jan,Feb,March 2018?

4.Use logistic regression to predict the 90-day repeat of users acquired in November 2018.
   Featured Used: Source, Slot of Booking, Gap between date of Booking and date of service requested as 
   predictor variables
.
5. Plot the distribution of users by frequency of their 90-day repeat (Number of times user repeated within first 
    90 days).

Hi,
I have documented the code in the inside the Jupyter Notebbok which also contain the code for the answers to the question.

Q123 answers question 1,2 and 3.
Q4 ans is with in the Logistic Regression Model.ipynb Notebook.
Q5.ipynb answers question 5.

Please do see the answers.
